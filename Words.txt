I have this great feeling of depression fall over me like a blanket smothering me a wild fire or a flood over a peaceful village.  I dug myself into a hole of despair  and confusion and now I wish to get out; not pay the price for my mistakes.  But by the laws I will have to one way or another.  I will have to choose that way, the way which will save me later.  I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.  I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.  I will, in a way, drown by something that should bring life.  I have become overwhelmed with things that should bring relief. I was not ignorant to see this ultimate fate if I chose this path.  I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.  The truth is that work and laziness are equal and will stay equal.  When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.  I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.     

//

Am I real? Do others control me? Why can’t I see the truth? I’m stuck in a form of mind I think? I’m not complete. What will complete me? 

// 

Never think before you write but think about what you write. 

// 

We do so much yet accomplish so little. 

//

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

Understand
1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.
6) Pleasures will pass so don’t live a life of Earthly pleasures and make them more important than life, others.
7) You are a light of God .  Don’t make the light a fire of rage which will harm instead of lighting the path for others.
8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it. 

//

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.  So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.  The truth is that work and laziness are equal and will stay equal.  When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.  I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.     

//

Am I real? Do others control me? Why can’t I see the truth? I’m stuck in a form of mind I think? I’m not complete. What will complete me? 

// 

Never think before you write but think about what you write. 

// 

We do so much yet accomplish so little. 

//

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

Understand
1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.
6) Pleasures will pass so don’t live a life of Earthly pleasures and make them more important than life, others.
7) You are a light of God .  Don’t make the light a fire of rage which will harm instead of lighting the path for others.
8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it.

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.  So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

 I have this great feeling of depression fall over me like a blanket smothering me a wild fire or a flood over a peaceful village.  I dug myself into a hole of despair  and confusion and now I wish to get out; not pay the price for my mistakes.  But by the laws I will have to one way or another.  I will have to choose that way, the way which will save me later.  I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.  I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.

I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.     

//

Am I real? Do others control me? Why can’t I see the truth? I’m stuck in a form of mind I think? I’m not complete. What will complete me? 

// 

Never think before you write but think about what you write. 

// 

We do so much yet accomplish so little. 

//

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

Understand
1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.
6) Pleasures will pass so don’t live a life of Earthly pleasures and make them more important than life, others.
7) You are a light of God .  Don’t make the light a fire of rage which will harm instead of lighting the path for others.
8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it.

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.  So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

 I have this great feeling of depression fall over me like a blanket smothering me a wild fire or a flood over a peaceful village.  I dug myself into a hole of despair  and confusion and now I wish to get out; not pay the price for my mistakes.  But by the laws I will have to one way or another.  I will have to choose that way, the way which will save me later.  I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.  I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.  I will, in a way, drown by something that should bring life.  I have become overwhelmed with things that should bring relief. I was not ignorant to see this ultimate fate if I chose this path.  I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.  The truth is that work and laziness are equal and will stay equal.  When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

Understand
1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.
6) Pleasures will pass so don’t live a life of Earthly pleasures and make them more important than life, others.
7) You are a light of God .  Don’t make the light a fire of rage which will harm instead of lighting the path for others.
8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it.

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.  So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

 I have this great feeling of depression fall over me like a blanket smothering me a wild fire or a flood over a peaceful village.  I dug myself into a hole of despair  and confusion and now I wish to get out; not pay the price for my mistakes.  But by the laws I will have to one way or another.  I will have to choose that way, the way which will save me later.  I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.  I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.  I will, in a way, drown by something that should bring life.  I have become overwhelmed with things that should bring relief. I was not ignorant to see this ultimate fate if I chose this path.  I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.  The truth is that work and laziness are equal and will stay equal.  When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.  I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.     

//

Am I real? Do others control me? Why can’t I see the truth? I’m stuck in a form of mind I think? I’m not complete. What will complete me?

Never think before you write but think about what you write.

1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.
6) Pleasures will pass so don’t live a life of Earthly pleasures and make them more important than life, others.
7) You are a light of God .  Don’t make the light a fire of rage which will harm instead of lighting the path for others.
8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it.

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.  So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

 I have this great feeling of depression fall over me like a blanket smothering me a wild fire or a flood over a peaceful village.  I dug myself into a hole of despair  and confusion and now I wish to get out; not pay the price for my mistakes.  But by the laws I will have to one way or another.  I will have to choose that way, the way which will save me later.  I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.  I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.  I will, in a way, drown by something that should bring life.  I have become overwhelmed with things that should bring relief. I was not ignorant to see this ultimate fate if I chose this path.  I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.  The truth is that work and laziness are equal and will stay equal.  When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.  I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.     

//

Am I real? Do others control me? Why can’t I see the truth? I’m stuck in a form of mind I think? I’m not complete. What will complete me? 

// 

Never think before you write but think about what you write. 

// 

We do so much yet accomplish so little. 

//

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it.

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.  So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

 I have this great feeling of depression fall over me like a blanket smothering me a wild fire or a flood over a peaceful village.  I dug myself into a hole of despair  and confusion and now I wish to get out; not pay the price for my mistakes.  But by the laws I will have to one way or another.  I will have to choose that way, the way which will save me later.  I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.  I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.  I will, in a way, drown by something that should bring life.  I have become overwhelmed with things that should bring relief. I was not ignorant to see this ultimate fate if I chose this path.  I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.  The truth is that work and laziness are equal and will stay equal.  When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.  I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.     

//

Am I real? Do others control me? Why can’t I see the truth? I’m stuck in a form of mind I think? I’m not complete. What will complete me? 

// 

Never think before you write but think about what you write. 

// 

We do so much yet accomplish so little. 

//

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

Understand
1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.

13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it.

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.  So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

 I have this great feeling of depression fall over me like a blanket smothering me a wild fire or a flood over a peaceful village.  I dug myself into a hole of despair  and confusion and now I wish to get out; not pay the price for my mistakes.  But by the laws I will have to one way or another.  I will have to choose that way, the way which will save me later.  I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.  I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.  I will, in a way, drown by something that should bring life.  I have become overwhelmed with things that should bring relief. I was not ignorant to see this ultimate fate if I chose this path.  I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.  The truth is that work and laziness are equal and will stay equal.  When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.  I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.     

//

Am I real? Do others control me? Why can’t I see the truth? I’m stuck in a form of mind I think? I’m not complete. What will complete me? 

// 

Never think before you write but think about what you write. 

// 

We do so much yet accomplish so little. 

//

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

Understand
1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.
6) Pleasures will pass so don’t live a life of Earthly pleasures and make them more important than life, others.
7) You are a light of God .  Don’t make the light a fire of rage which will harm instead of lighting the path for others.
8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.  So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

 I have this great feeling of depression fall over me like a blanket smothering me a wild fire or a flood over a peaceful village.  I dug myself into a hole of despair  and confusion and now I wish to get out; not pay the price for my mistakes.  But by the laws I will have to one way or another.  I will have to choose that way, the way which will save me later.  I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.  I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.  I will, in a way, drown by something that should bring life.  I have become overwhelmed with things that should bring relief. I was not ignorant to see this ultimate fate if I chose this path.  I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.  The truth is that work and laziness are equal and will stay equal.  When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.  I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.     

//

Am I real? Do others control me? Why can’t I see the truth? I’m stuck in a form of mind I think? I’m not complete. What will complete me? 

// 

Never think before you write but think about what you write. 

// 

We do so much yet accomplish so little. 

//

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

Understand
1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.
6) Pleasures will pass so don’t live a life of Earthly pleasures and make them more important than life, others.
7) You are a light of God .  Don’t make the light a fire of rage which will harm instead of lighting the path for others.
8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it.

So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

 I have this great feeling of depression fall over me like a blanket smothering me a wild fire or a flood over a peaceful village.  I dug myself into a hole of despair  and confusion and now I wish to get out; not pay the price for my mistakes.  But by the laws I will have to one way or another.  I will have to choose that way, the way which will save me later.  I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.  I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.  I will, in a way, drown by something that should bring life.  I have become overwhelmed with things that should bring relief. I was not ignorant to see this ultimate fate if I chose this path.  I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.  The truth is that work and laziness are equal and will stay equal.  When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.  I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.     

//

Am I real? Do others control me? Why can’t I see the truth? I’m stuck in a form of mind I think? I’m not complete. What will complete me? 

// 

Never think before you write but think about what you write. 

// 

We do so much yet accomplish so little. 

//

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

Understand
1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.
6) Pleasures will pass so don’t live a life of Earthly pleasures and make them more important than life, others.
7) You are a light of God .  Don’t make the light a fire of rage which will harm instead of lighting the path for others.
8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it.

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.

I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.  I will, in a way, drown by something that should bring life.  I have become overwhelmed with things that should bring relief. I was not ignorant to see this ultimate fate if I chose this path.  I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.  The truth is that work and laziness are equal and will stay equal.  When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.  I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.     

//

Am I real? Do others control me? Why can’t I see the truth? I’m stuck in a form of mind I think? I’m not complete. What will complete me? 

// 

Never think before you write but think about what you write. 

// 

We do so much yet accomplish so little. 

//

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

Understand
1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.
6) Pleasures will pass so don’t live a life of Earthly pleasures and make them more important than life, others.
7) You are a light of God .  Don’t make the light a fire of rage which will harm instead of lighting the path for others.
8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it.

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.  So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.  I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.     

//

Am I real? Do others control me? Why can’t I see the truth? I’m stuck in a form of mind I think? I’m not complete. What will complete me? 

// 

Never think before you write but think about what you write. 

// 

We do so much yet accomplish so little. 

//

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

Understand
1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.
6) Pleasures will pass so don’t live a life of Earthly pleasures and make them more important than life, others.
7) You are a light of God .  Don’t make the light a fire of rage which will harm instead of lighting the path for others.
8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it.

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.  So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

 I have this great feeling of depression fall over me like a blanket smothering me a wild fire or a flood over a peaceful village.  I dug myself into a hole of despair  and confusion and now I wish to get out; not pay the price for my mistakes.  But by the laws I will have to one way or another.  I will have to choose that way, the way which will save me later.  I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.  I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.  I will, in a way, drown by something that should bring life.  I have become overwhelmed with things that should bring relief. I was not ignorant to see this ultimate fate if I chose this path.  I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.

Never think before you write but think about what you write. 

// 

We do so much yet accomplish so little. 

//

In the noisy world all I hear is silence. 

// 

In a world full of chaos order is somewhat invisible and beautiful.  A depressing fact of life is that of human sight and life not having strict boundaries of what it is but is viewed by what man chooses to see.  As it flows we look on as it goes by and turmoil shows its face.  Confusion, like chaos, is a mass of darkness where all is lost along with truth.  Pressing forward to what we know as righteous, the mist of confusion sometimes blinds us and the goal is then formless and you forget where the righteous lay.  The confusion is not random but constant as long as we allow things other than what is pure into our sights and hearts where the two opposites pull on our souls and nothing is gained.

Understand
1) The eyes are the window to the mind, soul, and emotions.  Look and you will see the truth of others.
2) The body is seductive and is not what it seems.
3) The weakness of others physically, mentally, should not be a tool against the person but a warning to to others that the weakness, not of choice, is met by its equal of strength and that the body is not what it seems.
4) Always think death is coming soon and act on the basis of what you want others to remember you for.
5) Listen then understand.  Never listen then speak.
6) Pleasures will pass so don’t live a life of Earthly pleasures and make them more important than life, others.
7) You are a light of God .  Don’t make the light a fire of rage which will harm instead of lighting the path for others.
8) Don’t expect what you want will happen or you will be let down, hurt, angered always because God’s way is what you should work for.
9) Religion is sometimes a veil or a self improvement instead of seeing his power, his works, its something we rely on rather than God.
10) Is there anything else besides life and God?!
11) Understand not figure out or find fault because faults fade and when you don’t understand you don’t know the truth.   
12) Know what the problem is so you can find the correct answer.
13) Look at an object and ask what’s its purpose.  Then look at yourself and ask what is my purpose. You are no different than anything else in the fact that you have a purpose.

Coming to the hole I look past it and fall into it.  
Looking out of the hole I see the sun and envy those not in the hole.
I see a ladder and fear to climb it.
Why? 
But when I do I am filled with Joy. 
Why?
To stop this whole thing which takes time and strength I could see the hole and go around it.

Let’s look at competition and greed.  Is there a difference? OK greed is the want to have something that you don’t have.  Competition is the same but is also a race to end up in the lead.  We try this many different ways or times.  We want to be in the lead in the beginning.  We don’t know it but later in the race we will be behind.  We try to be in the lead by having the most friends, the most stuff, the most money, or the best looks.  But friends will hold you back, the stuff will weigh you down, and your looks will occupy your time.  Then when you slow down the friends will leave, the stuff will break, and the looks will fade then you’ll be lost in the race and will have nothing.  The last will be first, the first will be last.  So be lat and run fast when the first slow down.

 I have this great feeling of depression fall over me like a blanket smothering me a wild fire or a flood over a peaceful village.  I dug myself into a hole of despair  and confusion and now I wish to get out; not pay the price for my mistakes.  But by the laws I will have to one way or another.  I will have to choose that way, the way which will save me later.  I’m scared and I don’t know what to do.  I just want to lay down and rest but the realizing fact hits me with full force that when the rain comes I will drown in this deep hole of ignorance and obtuseness.  I will, in a way, drown by something that should bring life.  I have become overwhelmed with things that should bring relief. I was not ignorant to see this ultimate fate if I chose this path.  I just looked away with words such as “this would never happen to me”, but it has because I chose this path and this whole event could have been skipped if I chose work over laziness.  The truth is that work and laziness are equal and will stay equal.  When time is involved in this equation of life will cause troubles if laziness is all I practiced then work is what I will experience in a short time period and to go through it without the experience of hard work or good habits this will be hard to go through.  I will have to put out and do what I haven’t done before and work until everything is done when it is needed done then according to the equation, rest and work would be my reward; things will go back to normal.
